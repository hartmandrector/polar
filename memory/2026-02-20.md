# 2026-02-20 — Context Library Created

## Context Packs Completed
Created full context library at `docs/contexts/` with 8 files (~1360 lines total):
- `model-registry.md` — GLB geometry, scaling, coordinate transforms, assemblies (existed prior)
- `canopy-system.md` — Ibex UL canopy: cells, flaps, lines, deployment, pilot, mass
- `wingsuit-aero.md` — Aura 5: 6 segments, throttle, dirty flying, planform
- `physics-engine.md` — 6DOF EOM, forces, Kirchhoff, ω×r, apparent mass, sim, composite frame
- `export-system.md` — OUTPUT.md export plan, descriptor pattern (planning stage, not implemented)
- `visualization.md` — Three.js scene, model loading, force arrows, CG offset, NED↔Three.js mapping
- `charts.md` — Chart.js panels, sweep modes, AOA color, readout, debug panel
- `README.md` — Master index + usage instructions

## Key Design Decisions
- Each context pack follows: Scope → Key Files → Architecture → Constraints → Related Contexts
- Context packs are ~5-10k tokens each vs ~50k+ for full source + docs — ~5× reduction
- Packs are **indexes into reference docs** with tribal knowledge (constraints, gotchas, settled decisions)
- Hartman approved model-registry.md format; remaining packs follow same structure

## Status
- All 7 domain contexts + README written, pending Hartman review
- 22 files from Feb 19 sessions still pending commit (+3212/−1991)
- These new context files also need committing
