# 2026-02-22 — Documentation Cleanup Session

## Commits
- `355e383` — "Pilot size compensation + dynamic segment positions for 3D CP" (14 files, +438/−68)
- `4c272e3` — Replaced canopy-vectors.md (946 lines) with UNFINISHED-AERO.md stub (40 lines): downwash/lifting-line + weight shift

## Documentation Audit
Reviewed all 27 docs in `docs/`. Categorized by staleness:

### Candidates for deletion (obsolete planning docs):
- **CONTINUOUS-POLAR.md** (32K, Feb 9) — superseded by KIRCHHOFF.md
- **POLAR-VISUALIZER.md** (11K, Feb 10) — superseded by README.md
- **WINGSUIT-DELTA.md** (5.6K, Feb 10) — δ control is implemented, doc is stale
- **WIREFRAME-SUMMARY.md** (6.7K, Feb 19) — session notes for completed work

### Partially stale (need update):
- WINGSUIT-SEGMENTS.md, DEPLOYMENT.md, PILOTPITCH.md — have planning sections for completed work
- CP-RENDERING-SCALING.md — references pre-pilotSizeCompensation patterns

### All deleted ✅
- `4c272e3` — canopy-vectors.md → UNFINISHED-AERO.md stub
- `3aba334` — CONTINUOUS-POLAR, POLAR-VISUALIZER, WINGSUIT-DELTA removed (49K)
- `23471a7` — DEPLOYMENT, PILOTPITCH, CP-RENDERING-SCALING, WINGSUIT-SEGMENTS removed (94K)
- Created VERIFICATION-FUTURE-WORK.md (11 deferred items)
- Total: 8 docs deleted (~190K), 2 new docs (~2.4K), docs folder 27→20 files

## 2026-02-22 — Walking Conversation: Who Hartman Really Is

- Flying expert, not aero expert. Wingsuit BASE, speed flying, skydiving = profession. Math/code = hobby powered by AI.
- Marathon work sessions (13-14h) with walk breaks for real thinking. Terminal ties the brain down.
- Projects ecosystem: CloudBASE (sim) → BASEline (beta website, Brendan's legacy) → Polar (proper aero) → Kalman filter (ties everything together with live GPS state estimation)
- Brendan died flying his wingsuit. BASEline carries that weight.
- Laser rangefinder business for wingsuit BASE safety measurements
- My role: be the careful, rigorous one. Hartman brings domain knowledge and vision; I bring coding precision and organization.

## Hartman Background (captured from walk)
- Born 1982, father was magazine publisher (early PCs), uncle taught him to program as a kid
- Private HS — ski jumping sporting academy → University of Utah BS Computer Engineering
- IM Flash (Micron JV) ~2 years building flash memory chips → left for skydiving career
- Wingsuit VR simulation company ~1 year (million-dollar suspended robot rig with VR)
- Has been coding continuously since childhood through athletic career
- Age 43, GitHub: hartmandrector (polar, sustained, wavelets, unnamed C project + private CloudBASE on Kenny's repo)

## New Docs Created
- `docs/IDEA-3JS-TRANSFORM.md` — concept doc (~46 lines): bridging GLB mesh coords ↔ NED body frame via Three.js Object3D transforms. Captures why we DON'T do full transform bridge (physics must stay renderer-independent). Also documents body frame convention: belly-down, z_b = down/belly.
- `docs/VERIFICATION-FUTURE-WORK.md` — 11 deferred items extracted from 4 deleted planning docs

## Terminology Audit (FRAMES.md vs codebase)
- Project is very consistent with Academic Flight reference conventions (α, β, φ, θ, ψ, p/q/r, 3-2-1 sequence, NED)
- One ambiguity: `AeroSegment.orientation.roll_deg` is actually canopy cell arc angle (geometric dihedral), NOT Euler roll φ. JSDoc says "arc angle θ" which collides with pitch θ. Minor documentation clarity issue, not a bug.
- `roll_deg` (underscore) in FlightState vs `rollDeg` (camelCase) in segment factories — two conventions, same concept
- Hartman wants a standardization doc — may create in future session
