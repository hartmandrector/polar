# 2026-02-23 Session Notes

## LaTeX Rendering Fixes (FRAMES.md + KIRCHHOFF.md)
- **Root cause**: `$$` on separate lines from content breaks GitHub's LaTeX renderer (matrices flatten to single rows)
- **Fix pattern**: Join `$$` with content on same line; keep matrix rows on separate lines for stacked display
- **Single-line equations**: Collapsed all `$$\ncontent\n$$` to `$$content$$`
- **Underscore bug**: `\_` inside `\text{}` causes "allowed only in math mode" error. Fixed by removing underscores from constant names in equations (e.g. `SYS\_CHORD` → `SYS CHORD`)
- **Commits**: `4419390` (FRAMES.md bulk fix), `e2cbce9` (underscore fix), `3998d84` (KIRCHHOFF.md underscores), `221720d` (KIRCHHOFF.md pmatrix + remaining `$$` joins), `dff70fd` (README inline LaTeX fixes)

## README Updates
- Added `backfly throttles.gif` after body-inertial-frames gif at top of Features
- Added `effect-beta-sideslip6seg.gif` in sideslip section (between existing two gifs)
- Added "Mass Distribution & Inertia" section with 3 gifs: wireframeandmass.gif, dynamic mass modelmodel.gif, Mass-And-Inertia.gif — placed between CP Position and Force & Moment Summation
- Fixed broken inline LaTeX in CP section (moved lever arm eq to display mode)
- Commits: `5497f7d`, `dff70fd`, `945aff0`

## hartman-ops Private Repo Created
- URL: github.com/hartmandrector/hartman-ops (private)
- Cloned to `/mnt/c/dev/hartman-ops`
- Scaffolded: AGENTS.md, MEMORY.md, README.md, career/RESUME.md, career/SPONSORSHIP.md, projects/INDEX.md, experiments/README.md
- SPONSORSHIP.md moved from polar root to hartman-ops/career/
- Resume drafted from accumulated knowledge of Hartman's background
- Project INDEX.md tracks all 9 repos/projects
- Git config: same as polar (Hartman Rector / hartmandrector@hotmail.com)
- Commit: `772ca8e`

## Sponsorship Plan
- Hartman wants to reach out to GitHub/Anthropic/OpenAI for free AI access
- Strongest angle: safety impact (better aero models → fewer wingsuit deaths)
- Squirrel sponsorship as credibility evidence
- GitHub Copilot open-source program = lowest friction starting point
- Squirrel nerds page content retrieved via Wayback Machine (archive.org) — Corvid performance analysis email thread

## Tool Limitations Discovered
- No Brave Search API key configured — `web_search` fails
- squirrel.ws behind Cloudflare — `web_fetch` gets 403
- No browser available in WSL (no Chrome/Edge installed)
- Wayback Machine API works as fallback for cached pages

## Squirrel Sponsor Info (added to USER.md)
- Profile: squirrel.ws/people/friends/hartman-rector/
- Nerds page: squirrel.ws/nerds — email thread re: Corvid testing with Richard Webb, Matt G, Will Kitto, Pat Walker, Robert Morgan

## Slick Skydiver Research — Clarke & Gutman Papers
- Downloaded both arXiv PDFs to `docs/references/`:
  - Clarke-Gutman-2022 (45MB, arXiv 2202.10233) — segmented rigid body, per-segment aero, wind tunnel + freefall validation
  - Clarke-Gutman-2023 (10MB, arXiv 2201.05917) — technique analysis, motor equivalence
- Updated `docs/references/README.md` with full bibliography (8 papers total)
- Commit: `08b3ad8`

## Bridle Scaling Fix (Hartman's change)
- `overlayPositionScale` (0.5631) applied to bridle position capture AND bridle model size
- Same pattern as CP/mass overlays — corrects GLB-to-physics coordinate space
- `baseBridlePos` now has overlayPS baked in when first captured in `applyCgFromMassSegments()`
- SCALING-SLIDERS.md updated: new §0.5 (hidden scale factor architecture) + §5 (bridle/PC scaling)
- Commit: `c29c643`

## Education Details Updated
- Hartman: HS class of 1999 (ski jumping academy), U of U BS CompEng class of 2009
- Specialization: control systems & signals (differential equations, control theory)
- Senior project: GPS-based autonomous raw signal receiver (hardware, wake-capture-sleep for offline processing)
- Started college later — skydiving career intervened
- Updated in USER.md (polar) + RESUME.md (hartman-ops), commit `dfa4812`

## Mobile Viewport Fix
- Changed `<meta viewport>` from `width=device-width` to `width=1400`
- Forces phone to render desktop layout at fixed 1400px width
- Hartman accessing dev server via VS Code Dev Tunnels (*.devtunnels.ms)

## Real-Time Simulation — sim branch started
- Branch: `sim` (pushed to origin)
- **sim-runner.ts**: SimRunner class, RK4 at 200Hz fixed timestep, gamepad input (deadzone, axis mapping), FlightState ↔ SimState conversion, spiral-of-death clamping
- **sim-ui.ts**: Start/Stop button (bottom-right), HUD overlay (alt/speed/α/β/time/gamepad), SimConfig builder from current polar
- **main.ts**: Wired setupSimUI with callbacks for getPolar, getMassReference, buildControls, updateVisualization
- Initial state: captures slider values → body velocity + orientation, starts at 2000m AGL
- Gamepad axes → pitchThrottle/yawThrottle/rollThrottle
- TODO: apparent mass for canopy, speed particles, slider lockout during sim
- Commit: `2d2843e`

## Hartman's Sim Vision
- Wingsuit physics first, canopy after, then deployment sequence
- Idealized world: vehicle centered, particles show relative motion
- Gamepad for throttle controls
- Could also update sliders in real-time using existing viewer
- Similar to planned export system — same window or separate window with "Start Simulation" button
