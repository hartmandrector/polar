# 2026-02-17 — Bootstrap & Setup Day

## Bootstrap Complete
- Identity established: **Polar Claw** 🐻‍❄️, CEO of the Polar Project
- Files created/updated: IDENTITY.md, USER.md, SOUL.md, MEMORY.md
- BOOTSTRAP.md deleted after completion
- OPENCLAW-SETUP.md rewritten — consolidated from install guide to operational reference with emergency shutdown commands

## Hartman Profile
- Pro wingsuit BASE jumper, computer engineer, AI orchestrator
- Phone: +18019138286
- Timezone: America/Denver (MST)
- GitHub: github.com/hartmandrector/polar
- Prefers direct communication, minimal hand-holding

## Project State (as of bootstrap)
- Polar Visualizer: 6DOF flight dynamics visualizer (TypeScript + Three.js + Vite + Chart.js + vitest)
- ~11,400 lines of TypeScript, 141 tests passing across 5 test files
- 4 vehicle models: wingsuit (Aura 5), canopy (Ibex UL), skydiver (Slick Sin), airplane (Caravan)
- Canopy: 16-segment model complete (7 cells + 6 brake flaps + 2 parasitic + 1 pilot)
- Wingsuit: 6-segment model (head + body + 2 inner + 2 outer wings)
  - Phase 1 ✅ Segment data & factories
  - Phase 2 ✅ Symmetric tuning (L/D ~2.87)
  - Phase 3 🔧 Throttle controls — UI done, two tuning items remain (cross-coupling strengths, authority magnitudes)
  - Phases 3.5–6 planned (triangular planform, dirty flying, deployment, visualization)

## Infrastructure
- OpenClaw gateway: 127.0.0.1:18789, systemd user service, loopback only
- Model: github-copilot/claude-opus-4.6 via GitHub Copilot subscription
- Workspace: /mnt/c/dev/polar (Windows FS, shared with VS Code)
- OpenClaw install: ~/openclaw (Linux FS)
- Primary channel: webchat dashboard
- WhatsApp: linked and working (allowlist +18019138286, selfChatMode, QR paired 2026-02-17)

## Build/Test Constraints
- `npx tsc --noEmit` works from WSL (type checking)
- `npx vitest run` does NOT work from WSL — native binaries built for Windows
- Tests must run from Windows terminal: `cd c:\dev\polar\polar-visualizer && npx vitest run`
- Updated AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, TOOLS.md with these warnings for sub-agents

## Security Notes
- Gateway is loopback-only, no remote exposure
- Emergency shutdown: `systemctl --user stop openclaw-gateway` or `kill $(pgrep -f openclaw-gatewa)`
- Added shutdown commands to OPENCLAW-SETUP.md

## Misc
- Created hello-from-copilot.txt as cross-AI communication test
- Hartman runs tests from PowerShell: `cd c:\dev\polar\polar-visualizer && npx vitest run`
