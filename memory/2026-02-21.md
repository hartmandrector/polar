# 2026-02-21 — Session Notes

## Git Push from WSL
- `powershell.exe -Command "cd c:\dev\polar; git push"` works from WSL — no need for manual Windows terminal anymore
- Committed `974ad04` (scaling docs + reference doc moves) and `dbe78e9` (pivot consolidation) and `ad24dde` (cleanup: remove weight slider, trim angle implicit)

## Documents Created/Updated
- **SCALING-SLIDERS.md** — rewritten: pivot junction is now abstract 0–1 slider controlling `childScale/parentScale` ratio; trimAngleDeg noted as implicitly captured by assembly
- **PIVOT-CONSOLIDATION.md** — new 15-line doc: consolidate pivot values from 3 files into `VehicleDefinition.pivot` block
- **VEHICLE-SCALING-PLAN.md** — removed weight override (item 3), now only 2 sliders (pilot + pivot)

## Key Decisions
- Weight scaling removed from slider plan — handled automatically by aero scaling
- `trimAngleDeg` is implicitly captured by assembly system, doesn't need independent control
- Pivot junction slider is abstract 0–1, interpolates `childScale/parentScale` ratio with ±30% range around derived default

## New Untracked Docs
- **FRAMES.md** (721 lines) — complete reference frame catalog, DCMs, rotating-frame derivative, ω×r correction, integration pipeline. Written by Claude in a separate session.
- **KIRCHHOFF.md** (535 lines) — full Kirchhoff separation model spec: sub-models, blending, control morphing, all segment factory logic. Written by Claude in a separate session.
- Both are reference-quality docs, not yet committed or moved to docs/reference/

## Hartman Preferences
- Wants to read docs from phone via GitHub — push workflow confirmed working
- "Don't make it over 15 lines" — prefers concise planning docs
- Reviewed scaling docs on phone, gave feedback on pivot abstraction and trimAngle removal
