# 2026-02-18 — Session Notes

## MODEL-GEOMETRY.md Created
- Wrote comprehensive GLB model geometry registry doc at workspace root (~600 lines)
- Covers all 7 GLB files, 2 vehicle assemblies, all aero/mass segment positions
- Two separate configs for tsimwingsuit.glb: standalone wingsuit vs. canopy pilot (Hartman's requirement — same GLB, different contexts)
- Transcribed all existing spatial constants from polar-data.ts and model-loader.ts
- TODO markers on raw GLB measurements (bounding boxes, axes, origins) — Hartman needs to measure in 3D editor
- Includes: normalization strategy (GLB→meters→NED→Three.js), constants cross-reference, measurement checklist (4 phases), implementation plan (5 steps)
- Key insight: canopy cells use arc geometry formulas, wingsuit uses GLB measurements × GLB_TO_NED — registry should pick one source of truth per model
- Open question: CANOPY_SCALE (1.5) should be derivable from physical chord / GLB chord once measurements are taken

## Next Steps (from this session)
1. Hartman reviews MODEL-GEOMETRY.md
2. Fill in TODO GLB measurements (Phase 1 of checklist)
3. Create model-registry.ts with TypeScript interfaces
4. Refactor model-loader.ts and vectors.ts to use registry
